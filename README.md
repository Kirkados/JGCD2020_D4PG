# JGCD2020_D4PG
Open-sourced deep guidance implementation using the D4PG algorithm for spacecraft proximity operations as detailed in Hovell and Ulrich's JGCD 2020 paper under review titled "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Spacecraft Proximity Operations Guidance"

Built on Tensorflow 1.12.0

To run, optionally modify settings in environment_envs123456.py and settings.py. Then run python3 on main.py to begin training.
